PhD thesis in physics.

Development of a numerical method for the investigation of strongly correlated electron systems.
This method builds on top of Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT), adding non-local corrections. 
The approximate nature of this approach leads to inconsistencies that are partially alleviated by adding external thermodynamical requirements that are fixed using an effective parameter.

The predictive power of this approach has been demonstrated on the Hubbard moddel in three and two dimensions.

This thesis also contains two unrelated projects: (i) investigation of improved summation formulas for Matsuabra sums; (ii) a machine learning approach for the Luttinger Ward functional.
