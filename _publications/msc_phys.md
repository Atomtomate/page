Master thesis in phsyics. 
Numerical investigation of the Hubbard model on the simple cubic lattice in 3D and the bethe `lattice`.
For the investigation of the phase diagram in  the coupling strength `U` and temperature `T`, two state of te art Continuous Time Quantum Monte Carlo algorithms were discussed and implemented.
