2010-10-01	Consistency of potential energy in the dynamical vertex approximation	Physical Review B	This paper extends the existing ladder dynamical vertex approximation to include consistency of the potential energies between one- and two-particle level. The effects near the antiferromagnetic phase transition in the Hubbard model on the 3D simple cubic lattice are discussed.	Julian Stobbe, Georg Rohringer. (2022).
